## Subnational Conflict Data

<br>

**Multiple datasets** offer geocoded event entries:

- ACLED 
- UCDP-GED
- GTD
- SCAD
- Machine-coded dataset (e.g., ICEWS)

--

<br>

Events are coded with varying level of **geo-spatial precision**. 

- When there is insufficient information to attribute an event to a specific location, **the event location is "reassigned" to a nearby centroid/city** (depending on the data).

- All data offer precision codes for each events. These **precision codes are largely ignored** when running empirical analyses.




---

## Spatial Assignment

Event $i$ occurs within spatial unit $j$.

$$e_{ij} \in E_{j}$$
--
<br>
Spatial assignment is the process by which event $i$ gets mapped ("assigned") to location $j$. Spatial assignment is probablistic -- determined by some unobserved latent factor $Z_j$.

$$M(e_{ij},Z_j) \rightarrow a(e_{ij},j)$$
--
<br>
Spatial imprecision occurs when event $e_{ij}$ is assigned to a unit other than $j$. 
$$M(e_{ij},Z_j) \rightarrow a(e_{ij},k)$$
--
<br>
For every unit $j$ there exists a mapping to an arbitrary $k$. $R$ is a set of assignments rules (mappings to "aggregate assignment locations")

$$(j,k) \in R$$
---

## Event Counts

Common practice is to generate counts of events that occur within a spatial boundary.

<br><br>

$$ |E_j| = Y_j$$
<br><br>

$$ Y_j \sim Poisson(\lambda_j) $$
<br><br>

$$ log(\lambda_j) = \beta X_j$$

## Event Counts

Common practice is to generate counts of events that occur within a spatial boundary. 

Spatial imprecision alters the distribution of $Y_j$.

<br>

$$ Y_j \rightarrow Y_j^{obs}$$
<br>
Distribution $Y^{obs}$ differs from $Y$ in <u>two important ways</u>:


1. **The tail of $Y^{obs}$ is longer than $Y$**.
  - Spatial reassignment inflats the counts for some units. 
  
2. ** $Y^{obs}$ will be zero-inflated relative to $Y$ **.
  - Units $j$ where low values in $Z_j$ result in reassignment of all $E_j$

## Solution Concepts

**Aggregation**

- Subnational data that isn't really subnational $\rightarrow$ aggregate

--


**Truncation**

- Delete all imprecisely coded event entries. Only use the precisely coded entries when generating $Y_j$.  
<!-- - Deals with distortion in the tails, but doesn't deal with inflation in zeros. Doesn't eliminate confounding between $X_j$ & $Z_j$ -->

--

**Latent assignment probability**
- Estimate the probability assignment using missingness along other dimensions as proxy. 

--

**Simulated Reassignment**
- Reassign imprecise entries to units that are plausible origin locations. Fold uncertainty back into the estimate via bootstrap. 

--

**Overimputation**
- Multiple imputation on variables with measured with error.
